Note: Be sure to use python version 3.6.3 for this project. 
1) Create a directory on your computer (ex: /Desktop/mydirectory) 
2) Navigate to that directory.
3) clone this repo
4) create a virtual environment  with python version 3.6.3 specified.

***Be sure to activate the virtual environment you have created whenever you are modifying/executing code in the project.***

Please ensure that your virtual environment is not inside the repository when you commit.
There is no need to include the massive virtualenv folders inside the repo; instead, we can simply use the requirements.txt
to maintain the dependencies/necessary installs.

To launch the webserver:
0) Ensure that Django and all other dependencies are installed
1) Activate the virtual environment by navigating to "<name-of-virtual-env>/Scripts" and running the activate script
2) Navigate to the top-level srpaccessmanagement directory
3) Enter "python manage.py runserver" into the terminal
