Note: Be sure to use python version 3.6.3 for this project. 
1) Create a directory on your computer (ex: /Desktop/mydirectory) 
2) Navigate to that directory.
3) clone this repo
4) create a virtual environment called myvenv with python version 3.6.3 specified.
Use this name myvenv because this is the name listed in the .gitignore file. If you use another name for your virtual environment, be sure to add that name to the .gitignore file so that it isn't included in your commits. 

***Be sure to activate the virtual environment you have created whenever you are modifying/executing code in the project.***
